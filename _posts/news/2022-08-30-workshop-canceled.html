<p>
  Dear colleagues, we are sorry to inform you that the Workshop on AI & Digital
  Twins for Smart Cities (WAISC) as part of the virtual KI2022 had to be
  canceled because the required minimum of participants hasn't been reached. We
  ask for your understanding. We thank our partners of KI2022 who had spent
  time, energy and commitment preparing this event.
